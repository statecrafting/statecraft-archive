/**
 * The entrypoint's signal handling (spec 002).
 *
 * `docker/entrypoint.sh` is PID 1 in the shipped image, so container stop is
 * delivered to it and nothing else. Without a trap the shell dies alone and the
 * supervised processes are SIGKILLed at the end of the grace period, which
 * leaves rauthy's embedded hiqlite holding its WAL and state-machine lock
 * files and makes the next boot unclean. That is a shell-level guarantee with
 * no other coverage, so the real `shutdown` function is lifted out of the
 * shipped script and exercised against stub children here: the test breaks if
 * someone edits the function, not if someone edits a copy of it.
