/**
 * The governed watch surface (spec 032 §3.2, §3.10).
 *
 * The addon exposes `listenNext()`, one event per call, deliberately: putting a
 * threadsafe-function subscription in Rust would move cancellation and
 * backpressure to the side of the boundary where they are harder to reason
 * about. This module is the other half of that decision, turning one-event-per
 * -call into the `listen(handler)` shape the contract specifies.
 *
 * It runs exactly ONE pump for the process. That is not a convenience: hiqlite's
 * bus delivers each event to a single awaiter, so two concurrent `listenNext()`
 * callers would steal events from each other and each would see an arbitrary
 * half of the stream. Fan-out has to happen on this side.
 *
 * The channel is global rather than per-topic and hiqlite replays cache events
 * after a restart, so handlers filter and must be idempotent. That is not a
 * limitation to work around: notify is a latency hint and a revision watermark
 * is what makes a consumer correct (spec 032 §3.5).
