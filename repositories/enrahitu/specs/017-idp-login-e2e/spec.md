summary: >
  The rauthy driver's full browser round-trip (SPA -> same-origin /auth
  proxy -> rauthy login UI -> OIDC callback -> app session cookie) has
  been exercised by hand but never by an automated end-to-end test;
  this was the standing owed item from the enrahi phase close-out. This
  spec adds a Playwright-driven e2e that boots the app plus the dev
  rauthy (docker compose, spec 005), completes a real password login in
  a real browser engine, and asserts the session, profile, and logout
  behavior. Kept out of the default verify verb; runs as its own npm
  script and an optional scheduled CI job.

# 017: IdP login e2e

## 1. Purpose

Unit tests prove the token and cookie mechanics; nothing proves the
whole authentication topology (proxy path rewriting, rauthy redirects,
cookie scoping on one origin) survives change. One browser-real test
closes the highest-value gap in the template's confidence story,
especially before stamped apps put this flow in front of customers.

## 2. Territory

- `e2e/login.rauthy.spec.ts` (Playwright test) and `e2e/playwright.config.ts`.
- Root package.json gains `test:e2e` (playwright test) and the
  devDependency; vitest's include/exclude must not pick up `e2e/**`.

## 3. Behavior

- Setup: `npm run generate-keys` (RS256 JWT dev keypairs into keys/,
  which the app signs sessions with: a clean CI checkout has none, and
  their absence 500s the OIDC callback at token mint), `npm run dev:idp`
  (compose rauthy + secret sync, spec 005), and `npm run dev` (the app on
  :4000), all managed by Playwright's webServer config or a small
  globalSetup that starts and tears down.
- A test user is provisioned via rauthy's bootstrap/admin API (the dev
  compose already seeds an admin; the test creates or reuses a
  dedicated user with a known password; document the exact env keys the
  compose file expects).
- The test drives: open `/`, choose rauthy login, complete the rauthy
  form on the same origin (`/auth/v1/...`), land back authenticated,
  `/profile` shows the user's email via `GET /api/v1/auth/me`, logout
  clears the session (a subsequent /me returns 401), and no request in
  the trace ever left the app origin.
- The rauthy login page must be allowed to hydrate before the form is
  submitted (wait for network idle): its submit is a client-side JSON
  fetch, and clicking before the handler is attached fires a native
  urlencoded POST that rauthy rejects ("Content type error"). This
  surfaced only on slower CI runners, which is why the wait is explicit.
- Failure artifacts: Playwright trace + screenshot on failure, written
  under e2e/artifacts/ (gitignored).
- CI: not part of verify.yml. An `e2e.yml` workflow on
  `workflow_dispatch` + nightly schedule runs it on ubuntu (docker is
  available on hosted runners); flakes must fail loudly, not retry
  silently (`retries: 0`).

## 4. Acceptance

- `npm run test:e2e` passes locally from a clean checkout after
  `build:runtime`/`build:addon`/`build:app` (document the exact
  prerequisite commands in the test file header).
- Deliberately breaking the proxy (e.g. wrong issuer env) makes the
  test fail with a diagnosable trace, proving it actually exercises the
  topology.
- Spine gates green; vitest suite untouched and still 32/32.

## 5. Out of scope

- Load, MFA/passkey, and account-lifecycle flows (rauthy upstream owns
  its UI behavior).
- Running e2e inside the packaged container image (a later hardening
  spec may combine 016 + 017 into an image-level smoke).

Amended by spec 023 (2026-07-22): the e2e workflow installs the
`frontend-admin/` package alongside the two flavors, for the same
parse-walk reason the flavors are installed (the Encore tsparser
resolves every frontend directory's vite.config imports).

Amended by spec 005 (2026-07-23): the logout step additionally asserts
the response's `redirectUrl` points at the same-origin
`/auth/v1/oidc/logout` and carries an `id_token_hint`: the
RP-initiated logout wire fact, proven against real rauthy by API
inspection alone. The round-trip is deliberately not navigated, so
the suite's flake surface is unchanged.

## Amendment (2026-07-29): one frontend install in the e2e workflow

`e2e.yml` (this spec's territory) drops `npm --prefix frontend-react ci`
and the second lockfile cache path, for the same reason `verify.yml` did
(spec 010): the flavor slot retired (spec 015) and the parse walk now
resolves one SPA `vite.config` instead of two.

The suite itself is unchanged and still drives a real password login
through a real browser against the same-origin `/auth/*` proxy. One thing
it now exercises differently without any edit to the spec: the SPA under
test is the React app rather than the Vue one, so the "Sign in with
rauthy" affordance the test clicks is rendered by React Router's Login
route. The selectors are behavioral (visible text and form submission),
not framework-specific, which is why the flavor swap costs this suite
nothing.

The harness's real fragility is unchanged and still recorded in §3: the
trailing-slash `RAUTHY_ISSUER`, the `networkidle` wait before submitting,
and a fresh rauthy volume seeding the client. Those failed only on CI
before, and the docker-only dev loop (spec 001 §5.1 phase 1b) is what
removes that asymmetry.

## Amendment (2026-08-03): the test had been failing since the SPA moved (spec 004)

Two changes, and the first is the uncomfortable one.

**This test had been failing on `main` since 2026-07-29.** Spec 015's React
convergence split "are you signed in" from "pick a driver", moving the driver
list from `/` to `/login`, and this spec kept walking straight to the driver
link. Nothing caught it because `e2e.yml` is nightly and dispatch-only rather
than part of the PR gate, which is the same shape as the image workflow's known
gap: **a check that does not gate a merge will eventually be red without anybody
knowing.** The test now goes through the landing page, which is the route a
person actually takes.

**It also covers renewal**, which is new territory this spec should own. Spec
004's rewrite makes renewal a round-trip to rauthy, and the failure mode it
guards against is invisible to every unit test: rauthy refuses a refresh token
before its `nbf`, so an app that expires its session earlier than the IdP does
logs every user out permanently at its own TTL. The test decodes the renewed
token and asserts `exp - iat` equals the IdP's configured lifetime. That
assertion exists because the bug it catches shipped past a full green unit
suite.
