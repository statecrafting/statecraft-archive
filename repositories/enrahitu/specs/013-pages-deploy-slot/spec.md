  An optional, off-by-default GitHub Pages workflow that stamped apps are
  born with: it publishes the built SPA (backend/web/dist) as a static preview
  site when the repo owner enables Pages. Absorption line item LI-3 of
  spec 010. Not a contract verb: it is CI-side, not factory-side. The
  workflow must be inert (skip cleanly, not fail) in repos where Pages
  is disabled, which is the default posture.

# 013: Pages deployment slot

## 1. Purpose

Stamped apps often want a zero-cost static preview of their SPA without
standing up the container. GitHub Pages provides it; the template
provides the workflow so the capability is born-with rather than
hand-rolled per repo.

## 2. Territory

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` only. No template.toml change: Pages is
not part of the factory contract (spec 009 §Out of scope holds).

## 3. Behavior

- Triggers: `workflow_dispatch` always; `push` to `main` only when the
  repo variable `ENABLE_PAGES` is `"true"` (job-level
  `if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || vars.ENABLE_PAGES == 'true'`).
  Default posture (variable unset) means push events skip the job.
- Steps: checkout, setup-node 24 (npm cache), `npm --prefix frontend ci`,
  `npm run build:web`, upload `backend/web/dist` via `actions/upload-pages-artifact`,
  deploy via `actions/deploy-pages` with the standard
  `pages: write` + `id-token: write` permissions and the `github-pages`
  environment.
- All actions SHA-pinned with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment, matching
  `verify.yml` house style.
- **Project-site base path (amended 2026-07-15)**: a project Pages site serves
  at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`, so the build sets `PAGES_BASE` to
  `/<repo>/` (overridable by a `PAGES_BASE` repo variable, set to `/` for a
  user/org site or a custom domain). Each frontend flavor's `vite.config.ts`
  reads it as the Vite `base` (specs 006/015); the React flavor also feeds it to
  the router `basename` via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (spec 015). The build then
  copies `index.html` to `404.html` so client-side deep links resolve through the
  SPA router instead of a Pages 404. The container and dev builds leave
  `PAGES_BASE` unset, so `base` stays `/` and the image is unaffected.
- **Flavor-agnostic build (amended 2026-07-15)**: the workflow resolves and
  builds whichever frontend flavor directory the stamped app kept (`frontend/`
  or `frontend-react/`), since a stamped app carries exactly one (spec 015),
  rather than a hardcoded `frontend/`. The chassis, carrying both, builds the
  Vue default.
- **The needs-guard rule (hard requirement)**: if the workflow gains a
  dependent job (e.g. build then deploy), the dependent job's `if` MUST
  re-assert `needs.<job>.result == 'success'` whenever any custom
  job-level `if` is present. A custom `if` silently replaces the
  implicit success() guard, letting deploy run after a failed build;
  this exact bug shipped once in the template-encore era and is the
  reason this rule is written down.

## 4. Acceptance

- On a repo with Pages disabled and no `ENABLE_PAGES` variable, a push
  to main leaves the workflow skipped (not failed).
- `workflow_dispatch` on this repo (enable Pages on the repo first, or
  document the manual toggle in the workflow header comment) publishes
  backend/web/dist and the resulting URL serves the SPA placeholder.
- actionlint (or `gh workflow view` syntax acceptance) passes; spine
  gates stay green (the index hashes workflow files).
- A Pages build with `PAGES_BASE=/<repo>/` emits asset URLs under `/<repo>/`
  for both flavors and writes a `404.html`; an unset `PAGES_BASE` builds at base
  `/`, matching the container build.
- A react-stamped app (only `frontend-react/` present) builds cleanly: the
  workflow resolves the surviving flavor directory rather than a hardcoded
  `frontend/`.

## 5. Out of scope

- Publishing docs sites (that is statecraft.ing's concern).
- Custom domains for stamped apps.
- Any coupling to the factory contract or verify verb.

## 6. Amendment (2026-07-15): project-site base path + flavor-agnostic build

The original workflow served correctly only from a user/org Pages site or a
custom domain (Vite `base` defaulted to `/`), and hardcoded the `frontend/`
(Vue) flavor. Two additions, both inside pages.yml territory plus the flavor
configs their owning specs govern:

1. **Project base path.** The build sets `PAGES_BASE` (default `/<repo>/`,
   overridable via the `PAGES_BASE` repo variable) so a project Pages site
   (`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`) loads its hashed assets. The flavor
   `vite.config.ts` files consume it as `base` (specs 006/015) and the React
   router reads it as `basename` (spec 015); a `404.html` copy of `index.html`
   gives client-side deep links an SPA fallback. The container and dev builds
   leave `PAGES_BASE` unset, so nothing about the image changes.
2. **Flavor-agnostic.** The install and build steps resolve the surviving
   flavor directory instead of assuming `frontend/`, so a react-stamped app's
   Pages build works (it prunes `frontend/`, keeping `frontend-react/`; spec
   015).

Still out of the factory contract (no `template.toml` change): Pages remains a
born-with CI capability, off by default. Owning-spec edits coupled in the same
change: 006 (`frontend/vite.config.ts`) and 015 (`frontend-react/`).

## Amendment (2026-07-29): one SPA directory, no flavor resolution

`pages.yml` carried a "Resolve frontend flavor directory" step that probed
for `frontend/` then `frontend-react/` and failed if neither existed, so
the Pages build stayed flavor-agnostic across the chassis and any stamped
app. With the flavor slot retired (spec 015, contract v0.7) there is one
SPA directory, so the step is deleted and the workflow installs and builds
`frontend/` directly. The lockfile cache key drops to one path.

The `PAGES_BASE` mechanism is unchanged and still load bearing: a project
Pages site serves at `/<repo>/`, so the SPA is built with that subpath as
its Vite `base` or every hashed asset 404s, and the same value feeds the
React Router `basename` through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. The container
and dev builds leave it unset, so `base` stays `/`.

The workflow's inert-when-Pages-is-disabled posture (§3) is untouched.
