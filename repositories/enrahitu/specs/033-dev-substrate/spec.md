summary: >
  Phase 1b of the pivot (spec 001 §5.1). Development becomes docker-only, and
  the N=1 dev topology becomes the N=1 deployment topology rather than a
  parallel arrangement that resembles it. Five parts: a tiered compose
  topology whose default tier is one container and one volume; a single
  generator for infra.config.<topology>.json, replacing hand-maintained
  twins; a backend watch loop, which the toolchain's dev runner has never
  had; the app-level test harness, which boots the real compiled bundle and
  talks to it over HTTP; and the single-shot restore marker that makes a
  restore variable safe in a container with a restart policy (one variable
  when this shipped, one per hiqlite node since spec 027 §3.3). The harness
  landed first because it is what closes spec 025 and what specs 026, 027,
  and the control plane all build on. Between them the harness and a real
  boot of the topology found five defects nothing else in the repo could
  see, which is the case for verifying this by running it rather than by
  reading it.

# 033: The dev substrate

## 1. Purpose

Two problems, one cause.

**Development and production were different systems.** Development ran the
app under plain node on the host with rauthy in a hand-started compose
container; production ran one container with both processes under
`entrypoint.sh`, different key provisioning, a different infra config, and a
different cookie posture. That is the machine that produces defects visible
only in CI, and it has produced them: spec 017's login e2e needed three
separate environment-shaped fixes that no local run could reveal.

**Nothing could test an endpoint.** Every test in this repo was either a
pure module test or a subprocess test of a shell script. Neither can answer
"does the running gateway refuse this request?", which is the only question
that matters for a surface a stranger can reach. Spec 025 shipped four
acceptance items it could not prove for exactly that reason, and it said so
rather than pretending otherwise.

The cause is shared: there was no single way to bring the application up, so
there was nothing for a harness to target and nothing for production to
resemble. Spec 001 §4.1 deletes the zero-docker development invariant, which
makes one answer available for both.

## 2. Territory

Owned now:

- `testing/`: the app-level harness and the endpoint suites built on it.

  **At the repo root, not under `backend/`, and the extraction gate is why.**
  The extractor's usage walk treats every non-`.test.ts` file under `backend/`
  as application code and refuses bare `fetch()` there, because ungoverned
  egress from a service is exactly what `backend/kernel/egress.ts` exists to
  prevent. A harness whose entire job is to make HTTP requests at the
  application from outside is not application code. Placing it under
  `backend/` would have forced a choice between weakening that ban and
  misdescribing the file; placing it at the root makes the ban and the truth
  agree. `e2e/` (spec 017) is the existing precedent, and spec 019 already
  reserves the root for what is not an Encore.ts concern.

Also owned:

- `docker/compose.yml`: the default (N=1) dev topology. The cluster topology
  is spec 030's `compose.cluster.yml`; `compose.dev.yml` (spec 005's
  standalone rauthy) retires into this file.
- `docker/Dockerfile.dev`: the dev image.
- `scripts/gen-infra-config.mjs`: the infra config generator, which now owns
  `infra.config.json` and `infra.config.dev.json` as generated output.
- `scripts/dev-watch.mjs`: the backend watch loop.

It amends, without owning, `docker/first-boot.mjs` and `docker/entrypoint.sh`
(both spec 007): the restore marker in §3.5, and the one-line development
branch in §3.3.

## 3. Behavior

### 3.1 The app-level harness (delivered)

`testing/app-harness.ts` boots
`.encore/build/combined/combined/main.mjs`, the same bundle the dev runner
runs and the same one the container runs, under a throwaway data directory
with freshly minted RS256 keys and OS-allocated ports. Requests go over real
HTTP through the real gateway, so middleware, the auth handler, the kernel,
and the Encore router are all in the path. Nothing is stubbed.

It carries a cookie jar, because the session is httpOnly cookies (spec 004)
and `fetch` does not persist them: without one, the harness could only ever
test the unauthenticated surface, which is half the point.

**Two constraints discovered by building it**, both recorded because they
are invisible until something boots the bundle from inside a test runner:

1. **The child must not inherit the test runner's environment.** Vitest sets
   `NODE_ENV=test` and a family of `VITEST_*` markers; inherited, they put
   the Encore runtime in test mode, where it never opens its API listener.
   The symptom is a boot that logs nothing and times out, which reads like a
   hung application rather than a misconfigured one.
2. **`NODE_ENV=development` is the only correct default.** `test` is the trap
   above, and `production` disables the mock auth driver
   (`isMockEnabled()` is `!env.isProduction`), leaving the harness unable to
   hold a session. Both wrong answers fail in ways that look like application
   bugs.

That second constraint turned into coverage: an instance booted with
`NODE_ENV=production` proves the mock driver is absent, which nothing
previously asserted. `isMockEnabled()` is one line, and a regression that
inverted it would hand any visitor an admin session by URL. That is the same
class of defect the spec 025 exposure review found elsewhere, and it now has
a test.

**Cost, stated so the harness is used correctly.** Boot takes seconds, most
of it the hiqlite raft election, so one instance per test file in
`beforeAll`, never per test. It requires a prior `npm run build:app`;
`isAppBuilt()` reports that and suites skip rather than fail, because CI
always builds first (`verify.yml`) and a developer may not have.

**`startApp` waits on `/readyz`, never on `/healthz` (2026-08-04).** The
first version polled liveness, and spec 025's probe separation is precisely
why that was wrong: `/healthz` touches no dependency by design, so it answers
200 the moment the listener opens, while the raft election named in the
paragraph above is still running. The harness therefore returned an instance
that was serving and not ready, and the remainder of the boot was paid by
whichever request came first, inside whatever test happened to make it and
against vitest's five-second default rather than the ninety-second budget
`beforeAll` was given.

It passed for six weeks because the gap was under five seconds, and the gap is
not a constant: it grows with every domain that registers kinds and starts
controllers at boot. Specs 036, 037 and 004 each widened it, and it crossed on
a change that touched no code at all, surfacing as a timeout on an unrelated
assertion about the mock auth driver. That is the shape of the defect worth
recording: **a readiness check that is merely usually fast is a deadline nobody
declared**, and it fails first in CI, on whichever test is unlucky, naming
something that has nothing to do with it.

The fix is to ask the question the harness means. `/readyz` checks the ledger
and hiqlite, so `startApp` now returns when the app can serve rather than when
it can listen, and the wait is inside the boot budget where it was always
supposed to be.

### 3.2 What the harness found immediately

A harness earns its place by finding things, and this one did so before it
had a second suite.

**`encore.dev` had drifted from the runtime.** The manifest declared
`^1.57.9`, npm resolved 1.57.12, and the toolchain's runtime binary is
v1.57.9. The runtime prints a version-mismatch warning on every boot saying
this "may cause unexpected behaviour" and continues. Nothing in the repo
booted the bundle against the runtime, so nobody ever saw it: the dev runner
prints it to a terminal a developer is not reading, and no test started the
app at all. `encore.dev` is now pinned exactly, because a caret range across
a napi ABI boundary is a floating mismatch waiting to happen rather than a
convenience.

**Four defects in the dev topology, found by running it rather than by
reading it.** All are recorded because each is the kind of thing that is
obvious in hindsight and invisible in review:

1. **rauthy panics without CA certificates.** `node:24-trixie-slim` ships
   none, and rauthy builds a `reqwest` client during `init_static_vars`, so
   it aborts with "No CA certificates were loaded from the system" before
   logging anything of its own. Under the die-together supervisor the only
   visible symptom is "rauthy exited during startup". `Dockerfile.base`
   already installed `ca-certificates` for the packaged image; the dev image
   had to as well, and the fact that one file knew and the other did not is
   precisely the duplication this spec is trying to reduce.
2. **A named volume mounted at `node_modules` initializes root-owned.**
   Docker seeds a named volume from whatever the image has at that path, and
   creates it root-owned when the path is absent. The container runs as
   `node`, so the first-boot `npm ci` died with `EACCES` on mkdir. Creating
   the directory in the image with the right ownership fixes it, which is
   the same problem and the same fix as the `/data` ownership the packaged
   image needs (spec 007) and was not obviously the same problem until it
   failed.

3. **`entrypoint.sh` hardcoded `NODE_ENV=production` and
   `AUTH_DRIVER=rauthy`**, clobbering whatever the topology asked for. Two
   consequences, neither of which looked like its cause: `npm ci` omitted
   devDependencies, so the build toolchain was absent and the watch loop
   could not compile; and the mock auth driver was disabled, leaving a
   development container with no way to sign in. Both now use the `${VAR:-…}`
   idiom already used by `ENRAHITU_METRICS_TOKEN` and `ENRAHITU_LEDGER_URL`
   three lines below them, so the packaged image lands on the same values as
   before and the topology can state its own.
4. **The watch loop did not set the runtime environment.** A compiled bundle
   is not self-contained: it needs `ENCORE_RUNTIME_LIB`, the app metadata from
   the parse step, and an infra config with hosted services and gateways
   merged in. The toolchain's own dev runner does all three; the watch loop
   had to as well, and until it did the app died at import.

None of these would have been caught by a compose file that was written,
reviewed, and committed without being run. Two were in code this spec added,
and two were latent in `entrypoint.sh`, waiting for the first caller that
was not the packaged image. That is the argument for §4 item 8 being an
actual boot rather than a lint.

### 3.3 Tiered topology, docker only

Development is docker-only (spec 001 §4.1), tiered by N rather than by
whether infrastructure is involved:

- **The default tier is N=1**: one container, one volume, one command, rauthy
  on loopback and the app on the published port, exactly as the packaged
  image runs. Source is bind-mounted and the watch loop (§3.4) rebuilds in
  place, so the topology is production's while the iteration loop is not.
- **The cluster tier** is spec 030's `compose.cluster.yml`.

**One supervisor, not two.** The dev container runs the same
`docker/entrypoint.sh` as the packaged image, branching on `ENRAHITU_DEV` for
exactly one thing: whether the app process is the watch loop or the built
bundle. Everything else (first-boot provisioning, rauthy on loopback, the
readiness wait, the signal traps, die-together) is shared code rather than a
copy. That matters more than it looks: the trap handling was hard won, and
its absence left rauthy's hiqlite holding WAL and state-machine lock files so
that the next boot was unclean and could escalate to a crash loop (spec 007).
A second entrypoint would be a second place for that to regress.

The container's `node_modules` is a named volume rather than the host's,
because the addon and the napi runtime are per-platform binaries and a macOS
host's tree cannot be loaded by a linux container. The first boot populates it
and later boots skip, keyed on the toolchain's presence rather than the
directory's, since an interrupted install leaves the directory there and
useless.

`docker/compose.dev.yml` (spec 005's standalone rauthy, started by hand
alongside a host-run app) retires into `compose.yml`. It existed because the
app ran on the host; once the app is in the topology there is nothing for a
separate rauthy compose file to be separate from.

The N=1 tier is the same shape as the N=1 deployment, which is the property
that makes the divergence in §1 unrepeatable. It is not the same *image*:
the dev image mounts source and carries a toolchain, the packaged image
carries a built bundle and no build inputs (spec 007). Topology is shared,
build posture is not, and conflating them would put a compiler in the
production image.

### 3.4 One generated infra config, and a watch loop

**Generated infra config.** `infra.config.json` and `infra.config.dev.json`
are hand-maintained twins today, and spec 030 adds a third with its `pubsub`
block. Three files that must agree and nothing that makes them agree is a
drift generator. `scripts/gen-infra-config.mjs` emits
`infra.config.<topology>.json` from one declarative source.
`augmentInfraConfig` in the toolchain is the precedent: it already merges
the compile step's hosted services and gateways into the base at build time.

**Watch.** The toolchain's dev runner builds once and runs; there is no
watch, so every backend edit is a manual full rebuild. The frontend has Vite
HMR and the backend has nothing, which is an asymmetry nobody chose.
`scripts/dev-watch.mjs` watches the backend sources, debounces, rebuilds
through the toolchain driver, and restarts the app process. It lives here
rather than in the toolchain because the rebuild granularity is an
application concern and the toolchain ships on a different cadence.

### 3.5 The restore marker

Spec 032 §3.9 requires it and states the failure: `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` left
set in a container with a restart policy **re-applies the backup on every
restart and discards everything written since**, so a crash loop becomes
silent repeated data loss. rauthy's own configuration documents "remove the
value after the restart", which is a runbook step standing between a tenant
and their data.

Restore therefore routes through `docker/first-boot.mjs`, which writes a
marker into the volume recording which backup was applied and refuses to
apply it twice. The operator sets the variable once; the platform makes it
single-shot. Designing it out beats documenting around it.

**Amended 2026-08-05 (spec 027 §3.3): one marker became one per store.** This
section was written when the ambient variable was the interface, and that was
already ambiguous when it shipped: `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` is hiqlite's own name
and this container runs two hiqlite nodes, so one value naming one file was
read by both. The single-shot mechanism here is unchanged and is what spec 027
consumes rather than reinventing; what changed is that the operator now sets
`ENRAHITU_RESTORE_RAUTHY` or `ENRAHITU_RESTORE_APP`, the marker records a
decision under each key, and the entrypoint maps each into the owning
process's subshell. An ambient `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` is named in the log and
reaches neither node. Spec 027 §3.9 carries the reasoning and the two
decisions the build settled.

## 4. Acceptance

1. The harness boots the real bundle and serves real HTTP, with one instance
   per file. **Met.**
2. `/metrics` returns 401 unauthenticated, 401 for a wrong bearer, and 200
   with Prometheus exposition format for the right one. This is spec 025
   acceptance item 6, previously unprovable. **Met.**
3. The retired `hiq` write endpoints are unrouted (404) and `GET /hiq/health`
   is public. **Met.**
4. A full session lifecycle works over the wire: sign in, `/me`, sign out,
   `/me` refused after. **Met.**
5. A state-changing request without the CSRF header is refused with
   `CSRF_MISSING`, while the session survives the refusal. **Met**, and it is
   an assertion no unit test of the middleware can make, because it depends
   on the cookie and the header travelling together.
6. `NODE_ENV=production` disables the mock driver and mints no session.
   **Met.**
7. `encore.dev` is pinned to the runtime's exact version and the boot warning
   is gone. **Met.**
8. `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up` brings the N=1 topology up with
   no arguments, and a backend edit is live without a manual rebuild.
   **Met, verified by running it**: from an empty volume, first-boot
   provisions, rauthy bootstraps and answers on loopback, the container
   installs its own `node_modules`, the watch loop builds, and the app
   serves. Observed against the live topology: `/healthz` and `/readyz` 200,
   `/hiq/health` `{"status":"ok"}` (the addon is up in-process),
   `/api/v1/auth/status` reporting both drivers, `/metrics` 401 unauthenticated,
   and rauthy's OIDC discovery 200 **through the app's own origin**, which is
   spec 005's same-origin invariant holding in the dev topology. Editing
   `backend/health/api.ts` triggered `rebuilding: backend/health/api.ts` and
   the app came back serving without intervention.
9. Every `infra.config.<topology>.json` is generated, and a drift check fails
   if a committed one differs from its regeneration. **Met**, and the
   generator reproduces the previously hand-written files byte for byte, so
   adopting it was a diff of zero rather than a reformat that has to be read
   to be trusted. `check:infra` runs in CI.
10. A container restarted twice with a restore variable still set applies
    the backup exactly once. **Met** (7 tests), including that a *different*
    identifier is honoured as a new restore, that a boot without the variable
    clears a previous decision, and that an operator-supplied identifier
    containing a single quote survives being sourced by bash. The variable is
    `ENRAHITU_RESTORE_RAUTHY` as of the 2026-08-05 amendment in §3.5, where it
    was `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE`; the property asserted is the same one, now held
    per store.

## 5. Status

**2026-07-29, part one.** Sections 3.1 and 3.2: the harness, eighteen
endpoint-level assertions, and the `encore.dev` pin. Spec 025 moved to
`implementation: complete` on the back of it (see that spec's closure note).

**2026-07-29, part two.** Sections 3.3 through 3.5: the compose topology, the
dev image, the single-supervisor entrypoint branch, the watch loop, the infra
config generator with its CI drift gate, and the single-shot restore marker.
Verified by booting the topology from an empty volume rather than by
inspection, which is how the four defects in §3.2 were found.

What remains before this spec is `complete`: the `compose.dev.yml` retirement
(§3.3) is described but not executed, because spec 017's Playwright suite
still starts it through `npm run dev:idp` and moving that suite onto the
compose topology is its own change. Until then both files exist, which is the
duplication this spec exists to remove, and saying so is better than quietly
leaving it.

## 6. Out of scope

- The cluster topology and its Kubernetes placement: spec 030.
- The restore verb, its runbook, and the tenant assurance: spec 027. This
  spec owns only the marker that makes restore single-shot.
- Hot module replacement for the backend. The watch loop rebuilds and
  restarts; an in-process module swap is a different and much larger
  problem, and the rebuild is seconds.
- Replacing the Playwright e2e (spec 017). It drives a real browser against
  a real rauthy and answers a question this harness does not: whether a human
  can log in. Moving it onto the compose topology is §3.3's job; retiring it
  is not a goal.

## Amendment (2026-07-30): the watch loop stops going deaf

§3.4 shipped the loop and a session of real use found two ways it stops
working. Both were expensive out of proportion to their size, for the same
reason: neither announces itself, and both look exactly like "the code I just
wrote does not work."

**A stop that never finishes wedges everything.** `stopApp` resolved on the
app process's `exit` event. A process that had *already* exited never emits it
again, so the promise never settled, `rebuild` never reached its `finally`,
`building` stayed true, and every later change took the `if (building)` early
return. The watcher was then alive, silent, and useless. The only tell was
negative: the previous rebuild had printed `rebuilding:` and never printed an
outcome. Recovery was a container restart, which is how a wedge that costs five
seconds to fix became a habit.

Three changes, each closing one path into that state. A process that has
already exited is recognized (`exitCode`/`signalCode`) rather than waited on.
An absolute deadline settles the promise no matter what, on the judgment that
proceeding with a process that refused to die is worse in theory and much
better in practice: a duplicate app is a loud port conflict, while a deaf
watcher is invisible. And the `exit` handler now matches on process *identity*
rather than on `child !== null`, dropping the reference on every exit including
a signal or a clean zero. That last one is what produced the corpse the next
`stopApp` waited on, because the original guard cleared the reference only for
a non-zero exit with no signal, which is the one case that was already handled.

**inotify is not dependable across the bind mount.** Sources are mounted from
the host and events cross that boundary on the filesystem driver's good
behavior rather than on a guarantee. Observed: the watcher delivered events,
then quietly stopped delivering them for modifications to existing files while
still noticing newly created ones. Nothing distinguishes that from code that
does not work, which is what makes it expensive.

`fs.watch` therefore stays as the fast path and a periodic fingerprint of the
same file set becomes the floor (`ENRAHITU_WATCH_POLL_MS`, default 1000, zero
disables). Content hashes rather than mtimes, because a build step that rewrote
a watched file byte-for-byte would otherwise drive the loop in circles, and the
whole watched tree is well under a megabyte of TypeScript, so the scan is not
worth optimizing. Both detectors converge on the existing debounce, and the
fingerprint is refreshed when a rebuild is scheduled so that whichever detector
fired first does not leave the other holding a stale view and scheduling the
same rebuild again.

Also fixed: a watched *file* target reported its path as
`app-manifest.json/app-manifest.json`, because the callback's `file` argument
is a basename and was being joined onto its own path. Cosmetic, and it has been
in the log since the loop shipped.

**Not fixed here, and the larger half of the same session's pain:** the
hiqlite state-machine lock, which is spec 002's amendment for this date. It is
worth recording where the two met. Every rebuild stops and restarts the app
process, and because nothing releases that lock, every rebuild left the store
unopenable; the domain then answered 503 while `/healthz` stayed green. A
developer editing code therefore saw two unrelated-looking failures at once, one
of which made the other harder to see.

## Amendment (2026-08-01): a mail catcher in the topology (spec 026)

`docker/compose.yml` gains a second service. It is the first thing in this
topology that is not the application, so the reason is worth recording rather
than being inferred from a diff.

The IdP sends mail: password reset, email verification, registration,
invitation. Spec 026 owns that surface and had to concede that its delivery path
was unverifiable, because a live SMTP server is external state and neither CI nor
a laptop has one. A mail catcher converts that external state into internal
state, which is the same move this spec made for the whole dev loop: the reason
`npm run dev` was retired is that anything only reproducible on CI is a defect
you meet late.

**Mailpit**, on the compose network, SMTP on 1025 and a web UI on 8025. The app
service points spec 026's own `ENRAHITU_SMTP_*` variables at it, so the code path
under test is the production one and only the relay differs. Three properties
decided it over MailHog (unmaintained), Maildev, and Inbucket: a single static
binary, which is the shape this topology already uses for rauthy; MIT licensing,
which clears the permissive posture of spec 001 §4.7; and a REST API, so a test
can assert on what was delivered rather than a human reading a UI.

Two things it deliberately is not:

- **Not in any other topology.** It appears in the dev compose file and nowhere
  else. The packaged image takes a real relay through the same variables, and
  §3.3's tiering already establishes that the tiers differ in configuration
  rather than in shape.
- **Not a stored inbox.** Messages are held in memory and capped. A dev mail
  catcher that accumulates a volume is a dev mail catcher somebody eventually
  has to garbage-collect, and nothing here is worth keeping across a restart.

One consequence for anyone changing `docker/entrypoint.sh` or
`docker/first-boot.mjs`: both are COPIED into the dev image rather than read
from the mount (`docker/Dockerfile.dev`), deliberately, so a container still
boots when the working tree is mid-edit. The watch loop therefore does not pick
them up, and a change to either needs `docker compose up -d --build`. This cost
a confusing round trip while building spec 026 and is recorded so it costs the
next person none.

## Amendment (2026-08-02): the catcher gains a second sender (spec 037)

The amendment above put Mailpit in the topology for the IdP's mail. Spec 037
gives the application its own outbound channel, and the dev topology configures
it at the same catcher: `ENRAHITU_MAIL_TRANSPORT=smtp` pointed at
`mailpit:1025`, with `ENRAHITU_MAIL_FROM` set to an association address so the
sender identity is visible in what arrives.

**Both surfaces pointing at one relay is the normal case and not a shortcut.**
Spec 037 §3.1 keeps them separate because sharing one variable would be
privilege duplication; pointing two configured surfaces at the same host is
configuration duplication, which is what most real deployments will also do.
What the dev loop demonstrates by having both is that the two senders are
distinguishable in the catcher, which is the property an operator actually
checks when mail goes missing.

`ENRAHITU_MAIL_DANGER_INSECURE=true` is correct here and nowhere else: the
transport otherwise refuses a relay that offers no STARTTLS, and the catcher on
the compose network never forwards anything.
