# Refactor CLAUDE.md

You are helping refactor a CLAUDE.md file to reduce its size while preserving guidance through dedicated documentation files and path-scoped rules.

## Process

1. **Read and analyze** the current CLAUDE.md file in its entirety

2. **Identify extraction candidates** -- sections that are:
   - Cross-cutting patterns (not core setup/architecture)
   - Specific to certain file types or components
   - Large sections with detailed patterns
   - Content that would benefit from contextual loading

3. **For each candidate section**, recommend:
   - **Doc name**: What to call the extracted file in `docs/`
   - **Content scope**: What to include in the doc
   - **Path-scoped rule**: Glob patterns that should trigger loading this doc
   - **Replacement text**: Brief reference to keep in CLAUDE.md

4. **Suggest documentation table structure**:
   - Recommend which docs should be in the main reference table
   - Provide detailed descriptions for the "Description" column
   - Provide specific triggers for the "Read when..." column

5. **Create the files** in this order:
   - Extract content to `docs/[NAME].md`
   - Create `.claude/rules/[name].md` with appropriate globs and `@imports`
   - Update CLAUDE.md to replace extracted content with brief reference
   - Update the Documentation Reference table if it exists

6. **For path-scoped rules**, use this format:
   ```markdown
   ---
   globs:
     - "pattern1/**/*"
     - "pattern2/**/*"
   imports:
     - docs/DOC_NAME.md
   ---

   Brief reminder text with 2-3 key points referencing the imported doc.
   ```

## Key Principles

- **Only extract** sections that are specific to certain contexts (not universal patterns)
- **Preserve critical info** in CLAUDE.md (security rules, setup, architecture overview)
- **Use meaningful glob patterns** that accurately capture when guidance is needed
- **Keep replacements brief** -- just enough to know where to look
- **Documentation table entries** should have 2-3 sentence descriptions and specific triggers

## Good Extraction Candidates

- UI/styling patterns (CSS variables, Tailwind, responsive design, theming)
- State management patterns (Zustand, persistence, migration safety)
- Architecture patterns for specific systems (Tauri IPC, MCP servers, spec compilation)
- Testing patterns (integration tests, Rust tests, Vitest)
- Feature-specific guides (governance panels, agent execution, git context)

## Keep in CLAUDE.md

- Critical warnings (security, destructive operations)
- Development setup and commands
- High-level architecture overview
- General development guidelines
- Monorepo structure (crates, packages, apps, tools, specs)
- Orchestrator behavioral rules

## After Extraction

1. Show the size reduction (old lines -> new lines, percentage)
2. List all files created
3. Offer to commit the changes

Ask the user which CLAUDE.md file to refactor (default to `./CLAUDE.md` if not specified).
