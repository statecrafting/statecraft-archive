# /ship: gate -> review -> commit -> PR

Sequences the steps that turn a working tree into a PR. Bound by
`.claude/rules/orchestrator-rules.md` (checkpoints are real stops) and
`.claude/rules/adversarial-prompt-refusal.md` (do not edit an owning spec to
make the gate pass).

The gate is the installed `spec-spine` binary on your `PATH`. If it is missing,
run `/setup`.

## Step 0: preflight

- `git branch --show-current`. If on the default branch, STOP and create a
  feature branch first (`NNN-short-name` when the work belongs to spec `NNN`).
  Never commit straight to the default branch.
- `git status --short`. Confirm the changes are the intended set; surface
  anything unexpected before proceeding.

## Step 1: run the gate locally

If `.derived/` is committed in your repo, the binary regenerates it
deterministically: refresh it first, then run the conformance and drift checks
in order. Stop on the first failure (orchestrator rule: halt, do not silently
continue).

```sh
spec-spine compile                       # specs -> the registry
spec-spine lint --fail-on-warn           # corpus well-formedness (exit 1 on a warn)
spec-spine index check                   # staleness gate (exit 2 if stale)
spec-spine couple --base origin/main --head HEAD   # the drift gate (exit 1 on drift)
```

Outcomes:

- All pass: continue to Step 2.
- `index check` reports stale (exit 2): run `spec-spine index` to regenerate. If
  `.derived/` is committed, stage and commit the regenerated index with your
  change; CI runs the same staleness gate.
- `couple` reports drift (exit 1): the changed code is not covered by its owning
  spec's declared edges. Two legitimate paths, chosen explicitly, never
  silently:
  1. **Fix the coupling.** Edit the owning `spec.md` so its relationship edges
     (`establishes:` / `extends:` / `refines:`) and owned authority units cover
     every changed path. The gate enforces the declared graph, not prose. Do
     NOT edit a spec to retroactively justify code that contradicts the spec's
     design: that is a coherence-guard halt (surface the contradiction and
     stop).
  2. **Waiver.** Add a cited `Spec-Drift-Waiver:` line documenting why the drift
     is accepted. CHECKPOINT: requires explicit user approval.

## Step 2: review the diff

Invoke the `code-review` skill on the working diff. Apply confirmed, actionable
fixes. If a fix touches any gate input (a `spec.md`, a manifest, a schema, a
workflow), re-run Step 1 before continuing.

## Step 3: commit

Invoke the `commit` skill (conventional, impact-focused message) on a feature
branch.

- Never add AI attribution: no "Generated with ...", no `Co-Authored-By`
  trailers, in commits or PR bodies.
- If a waiver was chosen in Step 1, keep the `Spec-Drift-Waiver:` line with the
  change so the PR carries it.

## Step 4: CHECKPOINT, open the PR

PR creation is outward-facing. Confirm with the user, then:

```sh
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
gh pr create --title "<conventional title>" --body "<Summary + Testing>"
```

- The PR body is Summary + Testing. Include the `Spec-Drift-Waiver:` line inline
  in the body if Step 1 chose the waiver path with user approval.
- CI re-runs the same gate (`compile` / `lint` / `index check` / `couple`) on
  the PR. A local pass should mean a clean CI run; if CI still fails on a gate
  the local run passed, halt and present the divergence (orchestrator rule: halt
  on failure).

## Step 5: after creation

- After the PR merges, verify on-disk default branch (`git pull` + `git log`),
  not just the MERGED status.
