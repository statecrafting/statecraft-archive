  docs/ holds one 107-line file whose phase table stops at Phase 6 while
  the corpus runs to 024, so the human-facing overview describes neither
  the kernel plane, nor observability, nor the admin dashboard. There is
  no install guide, no upgrade procedure, no TLS or reverse-proxy
  guidance, no sizing, no runbook, and no troubleshooting. Everything an
  operator needs is currently reconstructible only by reading
  entrypoint.sh and twenty-five specs. The spec corpus is an excellent
  design record and a poor manual, and the two are different documents
  with different readers: a spec answers why this was built this way, an
  operations guide answers what do I type. This spec takes ownership of
  docs/, adds the operator surface, and realigns the two existing
  human-facing documents with what the substrate has become.

# 028: Operator documentation

## 1. Purpose

Every preceding spec in this batch ends by deferring its documentation
here, which is the clearest evidence that the gap is structural rather
than cosmetic. Spec 025 adds a trusted-proxy knob, a probe split, and a
metrics token an operator must find on the volume. Spec 026 adds a mail
surface. Spec 027 adds four verbs whose entire audience is operators.
None of that is usable undocumented.

The deeper problem is a category confusion this spec resolves. The
corpus is authoritative for design, and `.claude/rules/adversarial-prompt-refusal.md`
protects it from being edited to ratify code. That protection makes
specs the wrong place for operational prose, which changes with
deployment reality rather than with design truth. An operator reading
specs 004, 005, 007, 022, 023, and 025 to assemble a TLS story is doing
work the substrate should have done once.

Two smaller misalignments compound it. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ends its
phase table at Phase 6 and its component table names `frontend/` and
`docker/` as though nothing since exists, so it silently under-describes
the substrate by five specs. `README.md` frames the project as a phase
plan with a development quickstart, which is right for a contributor and
wrong for the buyer persona the substrate now targets.

## 2. Territory

This spec owns `docs/`, which is currently unowned by any spec: an
ownership gap this closes as a side effect of using the directory
properly.

It amends, without owning, `README.md` (root, linked to spec 001 through
the manifest key).

## 3. Behavior

### 3.1 `docs/OPERATIONS.md`

The document an operator reads once before installing and returns to
under pressure. Ordered by when it is needed, not by subsystem:

- **Install.** The minimum `docker run` that produces a working cell,
  every `ENRAHITU_*` variable in one table with defaults and whether it
  is a secret, and what first boot provisions on the volume.
- **Put it behind TLS.** The reverse-proxy story, which currently exists
  only as scattered implications: terminate TLS upstream, set
  `ENRAHITU_PUBLIC_URL` to the https origin (which flips rauthy to
  `PROXY_MODE`), and set `ENRAHITU_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` to match the
  hop count (spec 025). Worked nginx, Caddy, and Kubernetes Ingress
  examples, because getting this wrong is the single most likely
  installation failure and its symptom (login half-works) does not point
  at its cause.
- **Wire the probes.** `/healthz` as liveness, `/readyz` as readiness,
  and an explicit warning against the inverse, with the reasoning from
  spec 025 section 3.3 restated in operational terms: under
  die-together supervision, a liveness probe on a dependency check turns
  a database blip into an identity outage.
- **Scrape the metrics.** Where the token lives on the volume, how to
  configure Prometheus with it, and what the substrate actually exports.
- **Configure mail.** The spec 026 surface, with the consequence of
  skipping it stated in the first sentence rather than the last.
- **Back up and restore.** Spec 027's verbs as a procedure, including
  the stated RPO, the recommendation to schedule cold backups, and the
  reason the archive is a secret.
- **Upgrade.** Pull the new image, run `preflight`, run `migrate`,
  restart. What is safe to skip and what is not.
- **Size it.** Measured floors for memory and disk rather than guesses,
  and what grows: the Decision ledger grows with denials, the CoreLedger
  file with application data, rauthy's store with users and sessions.
- **Troubleshoot.** A symptom-to-cause table drawn from the operating
  history already recorded in the specs and the entrypoint's comments:
  the unclean hiqlite lock file and its crash loop, the Safari
  `__Host-` cookie failure over plain http, the legacy root-owned volume
  after the non-root change, the trailing-slash `RAUTHY_ISSUER`, and the
  sub-millisecond 401 that means session or CSRF rather than a bad
  password. This section exists because that knowledge is currently
  distributed across shell comments and spec prose, where an operator at
  02:00 will not find it.

### 3.2 `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, realigned

The phase table is retired rather than extended. It described a
build-out that finished, and a table of completed phases is a changelog,
not an architecture. The rewrite structures by plane, which is what the
substrate now actually has:

- the application plane (Encore services, CoreLedger, auth, idp, web),
- the identity plane (rauthy, same-origin),
- the governance plane (app-model, kernel adjudication, the Decision
  ledger),
- the observability plane (metrics, tracing, the admin dashboard),
- the packaging plane (image, volume, topology).

The component table gains every directory added since Phase 6, and the
document keeps its role as the human overview that points into the
corpus for detail.

The historical phase record is not deleted; it moves into a closing
section as the project's build-out history, where it is accurate.

### 3.3 `README.md`, reframed

Currently a phase plan with a development quickstart. It becomes: what
this is, what one container gives you, how to run it, and where to go
next (`docs/OPERATIONS.md` for running it, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for
understanding it, `specs/` for why). The development quickstart is kept
and clearly labeled as such, since contributors need it and it is
currently the only accurate section for them.

The `/hiq/*` curl examples are corrected for spec 025: those endpoints
now require an operator role, and a README that demonstrates them
unauthenticated would be teaching a request that returns 401.

## 4. Acceptance

1. `docs/OPERATIONS.md` covers every section in 3.1, and every
   `ENRAHITU_*` variable that appears in `docker/entrypoint.sh`,
   `docker/first-boot.mjs`, or `backend/lib/env.ts` appears in its
   table. This is checkable and is checked: a test enumerates the
   variables from source and asserts documentation coverage, so the
   table cannot silently rot.
2. Each of the three reverse-proxy examples produces a working login
   against a locally built image, verified once by hand and recorded as
   verified with its date.
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` names every directory under `backend/` and
   every plane in 3.2, and contains no forward-looking phase table.
4. `README.md` contains no unauthenticated `/hiq/*` example, and its
   first screen answers what this is and how to run it.
5. The troubleshooting table's entries each name a real, previously
   observed failure with its cause and fix; no hypothetical entries.
6. Coupling gate green.

## 5. Out of scope

- Generated API reference documentation. The app model (spec 020)
  already describes the surface machine-readably, and a generated
  reference is a separate deliverable with a separate audience.
- Fleet-level operations (multi-cell orchestration, rollout policy):
  statecraft's, not this template's.
- Tutorials and application-development guides for people building on a
  stamped app. Different reader, different document, later.
- Translation and localization of operator documentation.

## Amendment (2026-07-29): the architecture doc's frontend row

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (this spec's territory) records the SPA as React 19
+ React Router v7 in `frontend/`, owned by spec 015, replacing the Vue 3
row that spec 006 owned. Consequence of the React-only convergence.

This is a small edit against a spec that is otherwise `implementation:
pending`, and it is worth noting why it lands now rather than waiting: the
architecture doc is the human overview a contributor reads first, and a
first-read document that describes a deleted framework is worse than one
that is incomplete. Operator documentation proper (runbooks, the backup
and restore procedures, the tenant assurance) is still this spec's pending
work.

## Amendment (2026-08-06): the manual lands, and writing it found four defects

`docs/OPERATIONS.md` now covers every section of §3.1, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is
restructured by plane with the phase table retired into a build-out history, and
`README.md` leads with what this is and how to run it. §4 item 1's coverage
check is `docs/operations-env-coverage.test.ts`.

**§1 predicted this spec would be a writing exercise. It was not.** Documenting
a claim means executing it, and four things that every code gate passes over
surfaced the moment a real cell ran behind a real proxy:

1. **The image did not build.** Spec 007's amendment of this date carries it.
   §4 item 2 requires verification "against a locally built image", and that
   turned out to be the first requirement in the corpus that had to build one.
2. **The obvious nginx configuration is wrong for this application.** The OIDC
   callback sets two JWT cookies in one response, exceeding nginx's default
   proxy header buffer, so login completes at the IdP and then dies at the
   callback with a `502` while the application log records a successful `302`.
   The evidence is in the proxy's log and nowhere else. The example in §3.1's
   TLS section therefore carries `proxy_buffer_size`, and the Ingress example
   carries the matching annotation because ingress-nginx *is* nginx. Caddy
   needs nothing, which is the entire difference between those two examples.
3. **The cell must be able to reach its own `ENRAHITU_PUBLIC_URL`.** Server-side
   OIDC discovery fetches the well-known document from the public origin, so the
   container hairpins through its own proxy. Where that name does not resolve
   inside, or its certificate is not trusted there, `/api/v1/auth/rauthy/login`
   returns a bare `500` naming nothing.
4. **A freshly provisioned cell has no control-plane schema**, so its
   controllers log `no such table: controller_watermark` about once a second,
   forever, until an operator runs `migrate --apply`. Migration being a deploy
   step rather than a boot step is deliberate (spec 027 §3.4); a permanent 1 Hz
   error loop as the out-of-box state is not, and it is recorded here as a
   defect for spec 034 rather than documented away as expected behavior.

**§4 item 2 is met for two of three examples.** nginx and Caddy were each
verified on 2026-08-06 by driving a real password login through a real browser
engine against the packaged image behind that proxy, asserting both token
cookies are set and `Secure`, that `/api/v1/auth/me` returns the signed-in
operator, and that no request left the app origin. The Kubernetes Ingress
example is **not verified**: no cluster was available in the environment, and
installing one was out of proportion to the remaining uncertainty. Its buffer
annotation is derived from the nginx result rather than observed, and both the
manual and this spec say so rather than implying a verification that did not
happen.

**§4 item 5's troubleshooting table.** Every entry names a failure this
substrate has actually produced. Three of them are the findings above, observed
during this work; the rest come from the operating history already recorded in
spec prose and the entrypoint's comments, which is where an operator at 02:00
would never have found them.

**§3.1's sizing section is measured, not estimated**, against the packaged
arm64 image at N=1 on 2026-08-06, and says explicitly that it has not been
measured under sustained load. The one number worth stating here is that the
raft directory grows with *write volume* rather than with data size: an idle
cell added about 7 MB in an hour with nobody using it.

`implementation` moves to `complete`, with §4 item 2's Kubernetes leg recorded
as outstanding rather than silently counted.

## Amendment (2026-08-06): item 4 is fixed, so the manual stops describing it

The defect the amendment above recorded as item 4 (a fresh cell's controllers
logging `no such table: controller_watermark` at roughly 1 Hz, forever) is fixed
in spec 034's amendment of the same date, with the mail sweep's half in spec
037's. The loops now wait for the schema and say so once.

Two passages in `docs/OPERATIONS.md` described the old behavior as the expected
state of a new cell and are corrected: section 1's "Apply the schema once" now
shows the three waiting lines and notes that the membership surface answers 503,
and the troubleshooting entry is retitled to the symptom an operator will
actually see. That entry keeps one sentence about the old log line, because a
cell running an older image still produces it and the operator reading it needs
the same command either way. A troubleshooting table that only describes the
current build is a table that fails the people most likely to be reading it.

**§4 item 2's Kubernetes leg is unaffected and remains outstanding.**

## Amendment (2026-08-10): verifying the image, and installing without a network (spec 029)

The manual told an operator how to run the image and never how to
establish that the image was the one this repository built. Spec 029
closes that at the artifact end (cosign keyless signatures, an SPDX SBOM
attestation, a per-architecture air-gap bundle); this spec owns the half
an operator reads, so `docs/OPERATIONS.md` gains two pieces in section 1.

**Verification before install.** The `cosign verify` invocation with the
certificate identity and OIDC issuer written out in full, because a
verify command whose expected identity the reader has to guess verifies
nothing. It is documented as a refusal and not as optional hygiene: an
image that does not verify is not installed, and the text says that in
those words rather than leaving the operator to infer a severity.

**The air-gap path.** How to obtain the bundle for the host's
architecture, run its `verify.sh`, `docker load` the archive, and reach
the same first-boot sequence section 1 already documents. The bundle
carries this manual for the exact version inside it, so the copy the
air-gapped operator reads is the copy that matches the image; the
website is by definition unreachable from the host being installed.

This is the same §4 item 2 discipline: the commands are verified against
a locally built image rather than composed from the spec. The parts that
cannot be verified without a published release (a real GHCR signature to
check, and release assets to download) are marked as such in spec 029's
status rather than presented here as though they had been run.
