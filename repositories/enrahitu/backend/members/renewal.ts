/**
 * The renewal rule (spec 036 §3.7): a pure function of the membership, its tier,

 *
 * It is separated from the controller that performs it, and not for testing
 * convenience. A renewal rule is a policy a board approves: when dues are
 * raised, how long the grace period runs, what lapses and when. A policy that
 * can only be read as a sequence of store calls cannot be reviewed by the people
 * whose policy it is. Everything below is readable top to bottom by someone who
 * has never seen this codebase, and the store never appears.
 *
 * The date arrives as an argument rather than being read from the clock, so
 * every branch is reachable in a test at the date that produces it.
