# Spec: 020-derived-artifact-merge-driver
#
# Git merge driver `spec-spine-derived-regen` for the committed derived
# artifacts, which since spec 024 are sharded per authority unit:
#   .derived/spec-registry/by-spec/<id>.json        (compiler output)
#   .derived/codebase-index/by-spec/<id>.json        (indexer output)
#   .derived/codebase-index/by-package/<slug>.json   (indexer output)
#
# Sharding means two PRs that touch DIFFERENT specs/packages write disjoint
# files and no longer conflict at all. This driver covers the residual RARE
# same-shard conflict (two PRs editing the same spec/package): it regenerates
# BOTH artifacts from the merged working tree and hands the fresh shard named by
# %P back to git as the resolution, so a rebase onto a merged PR no longer leaves
# a derived-artifact conflict to fix by hand.
#
# Enable in this clone (opt-in, one command):
#   ./.githooks/enable-merge-driver.sh
#
# Or by hand:
#   git config merge.spec-spine-derived-regen.name "regenerate spec-spine derived artifacts on conflict"
#   git config merge.spec-spine-derived-regen.driver ".githooks/merge-derived-index.sh %O %A %B %P"
#
# Disable:
#   git config --unset merge.spec-spine-derived-regen.driver
#   git config --unset merge.spec-spine-derived-regen.name
#
# Path assignment lives in committed .gitattributes (the shard globs):
#   .derived/spec-registry/by-spec/*.json    merge=spec-spine-derived-regen
#   .derived/codebase-index/by-spec/*.json    merge=spec-spine-derived-regen
#   .derived/codebase-index/by-package/*.json merge=spec-spine-derived-regen
#
# Git invokes:  <driver> %O %A %B %P
#   $1 = %O  ancestor version  (unused: both artifacts are fully derived)
#   $2 = %A  ours temp file     (the driver MUST leave the merged result here and exit 0)
#   $3 = %B  theirs version     (unused)
#   $4 = %P  pathname being merged
#
# Fail-closed: if no spec-spine binary is found or regeneration fails, exit 1 and
# leave the conflict in place. The CI staleness gate (`spec-spine index check`,
# spec 004) remains the freshness source of truth; this driver is a convenience
# over the conflict, never a replacement for the gate.
#
# Known limitation (ported from OAP spec 188): regeneration is only as complete
# as the working tree at git's driver-invocation moment, so on some rebases the
# auto-heal can still emit a clean-but-stale hash (it cannot self-detect). Run
# `spec-spine index check` after the merge; the gate is the source of truth.
