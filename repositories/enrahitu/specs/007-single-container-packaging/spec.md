# 007: Single-container packaging

## 1. Purpose

"One Docker image + one volume = a complete authenticated application"
made literal: `docker run -v data:/data -p 8080:8080 enrahitu` is a full
deployment. No compose file, no sidecars, no secret management
prerequisites.

## 2. Territory

- `scripts/docker-build.sh`: the build pipeline (amended by spec 008: the
  vendored toolchain replaced `encore build docker`). The script builds
  from a CLEAN git worktree of HEAD and injects exactly four artifact
  kinds: the cross-built native addon, the built SPA (`backend/web/dist`),
  production node_modules (`npm ci --omit=dev` plus the linux libsql
  binding npm-on-macOS never installs), and the cross-built Encore napi
  runtime (`docker/encore-runtime.node`). The app bundle + metadata are
  produced inside the worktree by the host `tsparser-encore`; every SPA
  flavor source directory (`frontend/`, `frontend-react/`; the template
  carries them all, spec 015) plus the `e2e/` suite (spec 017) is dropped
  from the worktree since their devDependencies are not installed there.
  Local secrets (.env, keys/,
  .data/) are never in the image. The script asserts the base image's
  entrypoint verbatim so `docker/entrypoint.sh` and the image layout move
  together. The `[arch]` argument (arm64 default, amd64) drives both the
  injected native artifacts and the `docker build --platform linux/<arch>`
  target, so the image arch and its addon `.node` + runtime `.so` always
  agree; a native artifact whose ELF arch does not match fails the build,
  not the first request (spec 016).
- `docker/Dockerfile`: layers the rauthy binary (from
  `ghcr.io/sebadob/rauthy`, single dynamically-linked binary, same Debian
  family as `node:24-slim`), the prod rauthy config (spec 005), first-boot,
  and the entrypoint onto the app base image built by
  `docker/Dockerfile.base` (spec 008).
- `docker/entrypoint.sh`: die-together supervision (`wait -n`): rauthy on
  loopback :8081, the app gateway on :8080 proxying `/auth/*`; if either
  process exits, the container exits and the restart policy recovers it.
  Assigns the app's hiqlite raft/api to 8300/8400 (rauthy's embedded
  hiqlite owns 8100/8200 in the shared namespace).
- `docker/first-boot.mjs`: idempotent provisioning under `/data`: RS256
  JWT keypairs, the rauthy client secret, the rauthy admin bootstrap
  password, runtime secrets (enc keys, hiqlite raft/api), and the
  declarative client bootstrap derived from `ENRAHITU_PUBLIC_URL`. Existing
  material is never overwritten, so restarts and upgrades keep their
  identity.
- `infra.config.json`: the Encore self-host runtime config binding the
  app's secrets to `$env` references resolved from first-boot material;
  the build script augments it with the hosted services/gateways from the
  compile result (spec 008) into the image's `/encore/infra.config.json`.
- `.dockerignore`: context hygiene for both image builds; also keeps the
  vendored Rust toolchain (everything but the encore.dev JS runtime) out
  of the image and its context upload.

## 3. Behavior

- **Volume layout** (ARCHITECTURE.md Key decision 6): `/data/ledger`
  (libSQL file), `/data/hiqlite` (app raft WAL/snapshots), `/data/rauthy`
  (rauthy's own hiqlite + secrets), `/data/keys` (JWT + client-secret
  material). One volume mount.
- **One supervisor, die-together** (Key decision 5): no s6/supervisord in
  v0.
- `ENRAHITU_PUBLIC_URL` is the single external-identity input: it derives
  rauthy's PUB_URL/RP_ID/RP_ORIGIN, the OIDC redirect URIs, and the
  issuer; an `https` public URL enables rauthy PROXY_MODE for external TLS
  termination. A plain-http public URL (a local trial) additionally sets
  rauthy `COOKIE_MODE=danger-insecure`: the default `__Host-`/Secure
  session cookie is refused by Safari over http even on localhost, which
  breaks every login with a sub-millisecond 401. The app's own cookies
  follow the same scheme rule (spec 004).
- The entrypoint waits for rauthy health on loopback before starting the
  app, so OIDC discovery never races rauthy startup.
- Verified 2026-07-14 by the phase-5 smoke test: first-boot provisioning,
  same-origin discovery, PKCE login redirect, authorize page via the
  proxy, restart idempotency (no material regenerated), and the /data
  layout above.

## 4. Out of scope

- Orchestration (Kubernetes, Helm, restart policies beyond Docker's own).
- Multi-arch manifest publishing and registry distribution (the build
  script accepts `arm64`/`amd64` per invocation).
- TLS termination: external (reverse proxy / platform), signalled via the
  `https` public URL.

## Amendment (2026-07-22): repoint fallout in the image path (via spec 022)

The published-toolchain repoint (spec 018, PR #25) broke the packaged
image twice over, unnoticed because `image.yml` runs on cron/dispatch
and its last green run predates the repoint. Both surfaced by spec
022's packaged-image acceptance check:

- **Build**: the root `vitest.config.ts`/`vitest.setup.ts` now import
  `@statecrafting/toolchain` (a devDependency, absent in the image
  worktree's `npm ci --omit=dev` install), so the tsparser app walk
  failed to resolve them. `docker-build.sh` prunes both vitest files
  from the worktree alongside the frontend flavors and `e2e/`: tests
  never run in the image.
- **Boot**: the published platform carriers build their `.node`
  binaries on ubuntu-24.04 runners (glibc 2.39); the base image was
  bookworm-based `node:24-slim` (glibc 2.36), which refuses to load
  them (`ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED`). Before the repoint the binaries were
  cross-built in bookworm; now the published carriers are the source
  of truth, so the base moves to `node:24-trixie-slim` (glibc 2.41)
  to match them.
- **Kernel addon injection**: the target-arch injection step predates
  spec 021 and only knew the toolchain runtime, hiqlite addon, and
  libsql binding; a host-arch build left the image without
  `@statecrafting/kernel-native-<triple>` and the app failed at boot.
  The step now fetches and injects the kernel carrier identically,
  and the ELF arch check covers it.

## Amendment (2026-07-22b): the admin bundle in the image (spec 023)

`docker-build.sh` builds the operator dashboard (`npm run build:web-admin`)
when `frontend-admin/` is present (a stamped app with admin = "off"
carries neither the directory nor the script), injects
`backend/web/dist-admin/` into the worktree beside the SPA dist, and
prunes the `frontend-admin/` source with the other frontend directories.
`backend/admin/` ships with `backend/` as live service code.

## Amendment (2026-07-23): fleet-declared required env

The entrypoint gains a generic pre-flight assertion driven by one
variable: `ENRAHITU_REQUIRED_ENV`, a comma- or space-separated list
of environment variable names that must each be set and non-empty
before anything starts, first-boot provisioning included. All missing
names are collected and reported together, then the container exits
nonzero (the verify-born-with.mjs shape: every reason at once, one
failure). An unset or empty `ENRAHITU_REQUIRED_ENV` asserts nothing:
the required list is fleet-declared configuration, never substrate
policy (spec 001 §4.1: the substrate never assumes a platform above
it). The statecraft fleet's Deployment-command stopgap (statecraft
PR #64) reduces to setting this one variable.

## Amendment (2026-07-23b): the image runs as node (non-root)

The final image sets `USER node` (uid/gid 1000, the user every node
base image ships) and owns `/data` as `node:node` at image build, so a
fresh named volume inherits writable ownership. This lands the chassis
half of the statecraft finding: the fleet already runs the pod as uid
1000 with `fsGroup: 1000` (statecraft spec 006, E2E finding 3, fixed
fleet-side 2026-07-16), and statecraft spec 009 records that
"hardening the image to a non-root UID is an enrahitu chassis change,
not something to improvise in a Deployment". Nothing in the container
needs root: everything the runtime writes lives under `/data`
(rauthy's `data_dir` included), and both listeners (8080 app, 8081
rauthy loopback) are unprivileged ports.

Migration, stated honestly: a volume first populated by a pre-024
root-running container carries root-owned files the node user cannot
touch. Kubernetes heals this itself (`fsGroup` chowns volume contents
on mount); a plain-docker deployment needs a one-time
`chown -R 1000:1000` on the volume, and `docker run --user 0` remains
the escape hatch for a legacy volume that cannot be migrated yet.

## Amendment (2026-07-25): container stop must reach the supervised processes

The entrypoint supervises die-together but never handled its own stop
signal. It is PID 1 in the shipped image, so the runtime delivers SIGTERM
to it and to nothing else; with no trap installed, bash's default action
ended the shell alone and left rauthy and the app running until the grace
period expired and the runtime SIGKILLed them. The `kill` on the
die-together path (a supervised process exiting on its own) was the only
place either child was ever asked to stop.

rauthy is the process that pays for this. Its embedded hiqlite holds lock
files for the WAL and the state machine, and a SIGKILL never releases
them, so **every** boot after **every** ordinary restart begins unclean.
Observed on the live statecraft control plane 2026-07-25, on a boot that
had nothing else wrong with it:

```
WARN hiqlite_wal::log_store: LockFile /data/rauthy/db/logs exists already - this is not a clean start!
WARN hiqlite::store::state_machine::sqlite::state_machine: Lock file already exists: /data/rauthy/db/state_machine/lock
WARN hiqlite_wal::log_store: LockFile /data/rauthy/db/logs_cache exists already - this is not a clean start!
```

The warning is not the whole cost. On the same restart it escalated three
times to a hard failure before a boot got through:

```
thread 'tokio-rt-worker' panicked at hiqlite-wal-0.14.0/src/log_store.rs:47:21:
LockFile /data/rauthy/db/logs is locked and in use by another process
```

which aborts rauthy, which die-together turns into a container exit, which
the restart policy turns into a crash loop. Three restarts and about
forty-five seconds of extra downtime on a routine pod replacement, with
no bound on how many it could have been. This is the same failure shape as
the outage recorded in statecraft spec 009 (a rauthy abort the supervision
faithfully propagates), reached by a different route.

The fix is a stop handler that forwards the signal and waits for both
children before exiting, armed immediately after `RAUTHY_PID` is assigned
so a stop during the rauthy health wait is covered too. It exits 0: the
container was asked to stop and did.

`docker/entrypoint.test.ts` covers it, and covers the shipped function
rather than a copy of it: the test lifts the `shutdown()` body out of
`docker/entrypoint.sh` by text and runs it against stub children, so
editing the real function is what breaks the test. Four cases: both traps
are installed, SIGTERM and SIGINT each reach rauthy and the app, and a
signal arriving before the app has started still stops rauthy without
tripping over an unset `APP_PID`. The negative was verified by hand and is
worth recording, because it is the whole argument for the change: with the
trap removed the harness exits 143 and neither child is signalled at all.

This is the first test in the repo over `docker/`, which is the point. The
entrypoint is a shell script that has now caused two production incidents,
and "PID 1 forwards its signals" is exactly the kind of guarantee that no
TypeScript test can reach.

Consuming apps carry their own copy of this file (statecraft's diverges by
four hunks, recorded in its spec 002), so the same handler has to land in
each of them; it is not delivered by a pin.

## Amendment (2026-07-25b): a health check, and a provisioned metrics token (spec 025)

Two gaps in the packaged image, both from spec 025.

**`HEALTHCHECK`.** The image declared none, so a plain Docker or Compose
operator had no health signal at all. It now probes `/healthz`, the
dependency-free liveness endpoint spec 025 §3.3 separated out of
`/health`. The target matters as much as the check: pointing a liveness
probe at a dependency check means a transient ledger blip restarts the
container, and under the die-together supervision above that restart also
ends rauthy, turning a database wobble into an identity outage. `node -e`
with `fetch` does the probing, matching the entrypoint's existing idiom
(`node:24-trixie-slim` ships no curl).

**The `/metrics` bearer token.** `first-boot.mjs` provisions
`$DATA/keys/metrics-token` through the same `writeOnce` 0600 path as
every other secret, and the entrypoint exports it as
`ENRAHITU_METRICS_TOKEN`, letting an explicitly supplied value win so a
fleet can inject one shared token across cells. The packaged image is
therefore authenticated by default rather than opt-in, while spec 022's
always-on, unflagged contract for the endpoint is untouched (spec 025
§3.4). Provisioning stays write-once, so a restart never rotates a token
an operator has already configured a scraper against;
`docker/first-boot.test.ts` covers that property.

## Amendment (2026-07-29): the image worktree prunes one SPA directory

`scripts/docker-build.sh` (this spec's territory) no longer removes
`frontend-react/` from the image worktree, because the directory no longer
exists (spec 015, the React-only convergence). The prune list keeps
`frontend/` and `frontend-admin/`.

The reason the prune exists is unchanged and worth restating, since the
list is now shorter and could look incidental: SPA *source* must not enter
the image. Only the built bundles (`backend/web/dist` and
`backend/web/dist-admin`) are carried in, so the container ships compiled
assets and no build inputs. Removing a name from this list is safe only
because the directory is gone; it is never safe as a size optimization.

## Amendment (2026-07-29): the dev branch and the restore marker (spec 033)

Two changes to this spec's territory, both from spec 033.

**`entrypoint.sh` gains a development branch.** `ENRAHITU_DEV=1` selects the
watch loop as the app process instead of the built bundle. Everything else
(first-boot, rauthy on loopback, the readiness wait, the signal traps,
die-together) is shared rather than copied, deliberately: the trap handling
is this spec's hardest-won behavior, and its absence left rauthy's hiqlite
holding WAL and state-machine lock files so the next boot was unclean and
could escalate to a crash loop. A second entrypoint would be a second place
for that to regress.

Two hardcoded exports became defaults in the same change:
`NODE_ENV=production` and `AUTH_DRIVER=rauthy` now use the `${VAR:-…}` idiom
that `ENRAHITU_METRICS_TOKEN` and `ENRAHITU_LEDGER_URL` already use three
lines below. The packaged image sets neither, so both land on exactly the
values they had. The dev topology sets both, and before this they were
silently clobbered, which made `npm ci` omit devDependencies (no build
toolchain, so the watch loop could not compile) and disabled the mock auth
driver (no way to sign in). Neither symptom pointed at its cause.

**`first-boot.mjs` makes restore single-shot.** hiqlite applies
`HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` at boot before the raft node starts, and rauthy's own
configuration documents "remove the value after the restart". Left set in a
container with a restart policy it re-applies on every restart and discards
everything written since, so a crash loop becomes silent, repeated data
loss, and the operator sees a container restarting rather than one deleting.

first-boot now records which backup it honoured in a marker on the volume and
writes its decision to `$DATA/restore.env`, which the entrypoint sources
before starting either process (the same handshake as `secrets.env`, because
a separate process cannot unset a variable in the entrypoint's shell). A
different identifier is a new restore and is honoured. The operator sets the
variable once and may leave it set forever.

## Amendment (2026-08-01): the entrypoint scrubs before it maps (spec 026)

Spec 026 owns the IdP's mail surface and the reasoning behind it. What belongs
here is the change to this entrypoint's environment discipline, because that
discipline is this spec's concern: which variables reach which of the two
supervised processes.

Two functions, and their placement is the whole guarantee:

- `export_smtp_env` maps `ENRAHITU_SMTP_*` onto rauthy's own `SMTP_*` names and
  is called **inside the rauthy subshell**, so mail credentials never enter the
  app process. It is a function rather than inline exports for exactly that
  reason. Only variables that are set are exported, because rauthy distinguishes
  absent from empty for several of them.
- `scrub_smtp_env` removes any `SMTP_*` already in the container's environment
  and is called **at top level**, before either process starts. This one is not
  about mail configuration at all, which is why it is worth stating in this
  spec: an inherited `SMTP_PASSWORD` is a credential the app process would
  otherwise hold, and this entrypoint's job is that nothing reaches a process
  that has no business with it. That an `ENRAHITU_`-prefixed surface cannot by
  itself prevent an unprefixed ambient variable from being inherited is the
  general lesson; spec 026 §3.1 carries it.

`docker/first-boot.mjs` gains one notice when no relay is configured, naming
what is inert. It is a notice and not a failure: a local trial of the packaged
image must keep working with no mail server, and `ENRAHITU_REQUIRED_ENV` (this
spec's own amendment of 2026-07-23) is how a fleet makes it mandatory instead.

## Amendment (2026-08-02): each mail surface reaches exactly one process (spec 037)

The amendment above scrubbed the **mapped** names (`SMTP_*`) and deliberately
left the prefixed originals inherited. That was sufficient for what spec 026
claimed. Spec 037 gives the application its own relay under `ENRAHITU_MAIL_*`,
and with two mail surfaces in one container the prefix stops carrying the
guarantee on its own: a subshell inherits its parent's whole environment, so
rauthy would hold the application's relay password and the application would
hold the IdP's, neither because anything mapped them but because inheritance is
the default.

So the entrypoint now drops each surface at the point the other process no
longer needs it, and the ORDER is the guarantee:

- `ENRAHITU_MAIL_*` is unset **inside the rauthy subshell**, after
  `export_smtp_env` has run. rauthy reads `SMTP_*` and has no use for these.
- `ENRAHITU_SMTP_*` is unset **at top level, after that subshell has captured
  them and before the app starts**. Doing it any earlier would leave the IdP
  with no relay at all, which is why the placement is asserted rather than
  described.

The general form, which is this entrypoint's whole job stated once: a credential
sitting in a process that has no use for it is still that process's blast
radius. Two surfaces means two holders, and that has to be true in both
directions or it is one surface with extra prefixes.

## Amendment (2026-08-04): the pre-flight check becomes a verb (spec 027)

The 2026-07-23 amendment's `ENRAHITU_REQUIRED_ENV` assertion moves out of this
script and into `scripts/ops/preflight.mjs` (spec 027 §3.5), which the entrypoint
calls before first-boot and before either supervised process. The contract is
unchanged in every respect a fleet can see: the same variable, the same comma- or
space-separated list, all missing names reported together, a nonzero exit, and an
unset list asserting nothing. What changed is that there is now one
implementation of it rather than two, and the copy that lived here in bash was
the one nothing could test.

The verb checks five further conditions on the same call, so this entrypoint's
failure surface widens with it. A data directory the runtime user cannot write
(the legacy root-owned volume of the 2026-07-23b amendment), a ledger URL naming
no driver, an occupied port, and a public URL whose scheme silently selects
rauthy's danger-insecure cookie mode now each stop the boot here instead of
surfacing several screens later as something that does not name its cause.

Placement is part of the guarantee. It runs before `first-boot.mjs`, because a
pre-flight that ran after it would be validating a volume already written to, and
before the rauthy subshell, because one that ran after it would report on ports
it had itself just taken.

## Amendment (2026-08-05): two hiqlite nodes, two restore variables (spec 027)

The entrypoint gains a scrub, a mapping function, and a subshell around the app.
All three exist for one reason: this container runs **two** hiqlite nodes, and
`HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` is hiqlite's own variable name. A single ambient value
naming a single file is therefore read by both rauthy's identity store and the
app's resource store, and whichever node it was not meant for either refuses the
file or, worse, accepts it. Spec 027 §3.3 states the defect; this records what it
did to this script.

`restore.env` now carries two prefixed decisions rather than one ambient export,
and `export_restore_env` maps exactly one of them onto `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE`
inside the process that owns that store, dropping both prefixed names there. The
shape is the one this entrypoint already uses twice: `export_smtp_env` for
rauthy's mail surface (spec 026 §3.1) and the `ENRAHITU_MAIL_*` unset for the
application's (spec 037 §3.1). Two surfaces means two holders, enforced in both
directions or it is one surface with extra prefixes.

**The app moved into a subshell**, which is new and is load bearing. It started
at top level, where an export is visible to everything started after it, so
there was nowhere to put its restore decision that rauthy could not see. `exec`
makes the subshell become the app process, so `$APP_PID` is still the process
the traps signal and `wait -n` observes, and the die-together policy is
unchanged.

An inherited `HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE` is scrubbed rather than mapped, for the reason
spec 026 §3.1 scrubs an inherited `SMTP_*`: an orchestrator exporting a name
this substrate did not choose must not silently arm a restore here. It is
scrubbed *after* `first-boot.mjs` runs, so the operator still gets a log line
naming the variable that was ignored and the two that replace it.

**`docker/first-boot.test.ts` moves into this spec's territory with it.** Spec
025 established that file, for the `/metrics` bearer-token assertions of its
§3.4, and it has since accumulated the tests of everything else `first-boot.mjs`
does: the provisioning write-once property this spec owns, the restore marker
spec 033 designed, and now the per-store scoping above. Ownership followed the
first spec to need a test file rather than the script under test, so a change to
a script this spec owns kept landing in a file it did not, and the coupling gate
kept asking spec 025 to authorize restore semantics it has no view on. The unit
and its tests now sit with the same spec. Spec 025's own assertions in that file
are unchanged; only the authority over the path moved.

## Amendment (2026-08-06): the app's own encryption key, and the material that never left the shell (spec 027 §4 item 5)

Spec 027 §4 item 5 recorded a finding this spec is the one that has to answer:
nothing provisions `ENRAHITU_HIQ_ENC_KEYS`, so the app's hiqlite falls back to
the addon's publicly-known development key, and since that node encrypts its
backup snapshots with it, every cell has been writing snapshots anyone can
decrypt. Closing it turned out to require two changes rather than one, and the
second is the more interesting of the pair.

**`first-boot.mjs` generates a key set for the app's node.** It is a *separate*
key set from rauthy's, not a shared one. Spec 032 reads "a deployment custodies
one key set for both hiqlite instances", and what that requirement is about is
custody: one file to hold, one archive to keep. That is equally true either way,
because both key sets live in `secrets.env` and spec 027 §3.1 puts the whole
file in every archive. Sharing the bytes would buy nothing and would mean one
compromised key set decrypts both the identity store and the resource store.
Every other secret in this file is already generated per store, and the
entrypoint hands each store only its own.

**The entrypoint has to export it, and that is what was actually broken.**
`secrets.env` is *sourced*, and its lines are `NAME='value'` with no `export`,
so every name in it becomes an unexported shell variable. A subshell inherits
those, which is exactly why the mistake survives a careful reading: the values
are visibly present right up to the last moment. Then `exec` replaces the
subshell with the app, and a process environment carries only exported names.

So `ENRAHITU_HIQ_SECRET_RAFT` and `ENRAHITU_HIQ_SECRET_API` had been provisioned
on first boot and dropped at `exec` for as long as they have existed: the app's
node has been running on the addon's compiled-in defaults for those too, and the
comment at the top of this script claiming `secrets.env` "carries ENRAHITU_HIQ_*
for the app" described an intention rather than a fact. A newly provisioned
encryption key would have been discarded at the same line, which is why
provisioning it alone would have looked like a fix and changed nothing.

`export_hiq_env` is called from inside the app's subshell, for the reason
`export_smtp_env` is called from inside rauthy's: these are the resource store's
keys, and rauthy's process has no more business holding them than the app has
holding rauthy's. The two-holders rule of spec 037 §3.1 now covers key material
as well as mail credentials.

**A volume whose `secrets.env` predates the key is named, not migrated.**
Provisioning is write-once, so the generating block does not run again on an
existing volume. Adding a key there and activating it would orphan every
snapshot the node has already written, because those were encrypted under the
addon's fallback and that key is not one the volume records; retaining the
fallback as a non-active key so they still decrypt would mean committing a
publicly-known key to this repository. Neither is worth doing for a volume shape
that predates the first release, so `first-boot.mjs` reports the case, names the
consequence and the remedy, and leaves the file alone. The addon warns about the
same condition on every boot; this line is the one that says why and what to do.
`export NAME` on an unset name leaves it absent from the child's environment
rather than present and empty, so such a volume still boots on the fallback
instead of handing the node a blank key.

**What the tests assert is delivery, not configuration.** The environment an
`exec`-ed child actually has is the property under test, because a subshell that
reads correctly and delivers nothing is the whole defect. `entrypoint.test.ts`
runs the real `export_hiq_env` and then `exec`s, and separately asserts that a
process which does not call it receives none of the material. That second
assertion is the regression itself, stated as a test.

## Amendment (2026-08-06b): the image worktree prunes `testing/` (spec 028)

`scripts/docker-build.sh` could not build an image at all. The clean worktree it
assembles carries `testing/app-harness.ts`, which imports
`@statecrafting/toolchain/augment-infra` and `.../resolve` to boot an app under
test; those are devDependency subpaths, absent under the worktree's
`npm ci --omit=dev`, and the Encore tsparser walks the whole app root regardless
of any `tsconfig` exclude. So the parse failed and the build stopped.

This is the fourth instance of one pattern, and the prune list now says so:
`frontend/` and `frontend-admin/` (spec 015), `e2e/` (spec 017), the vitest
configs (spec 018), and now `testing/` (spec 033's harness). Anything that is
test-only and imports a devDependency has to leave the worktree, because the
parser's reach is the app root and not the build's intent.

It went unnoticed because `image.yml` is cron and dispatch only, so `main` can
carry a broken image build across many green PRs. Spec 028 caught it only
because its §4 item 2 requires verifying reverse-proxy examples *against a
locally built image*, which is the first thing in the corpus that had to build
one. That is worth recording as evidence for the acceptance criterion rather
than against it: a documentation requirement found a packaging defect that
every code gate passed over.

## Amendment (2026-08-10): rauthy enters the image by digest (spec 029)

`docker/Dockerfile` pulled rauthy by mutable tag:
`FROM ghcr.io/sebadob/rauthy:0.36.0 AS rauthy`. A tag is a pointer its
publisher can move, so two builds of the same enrahitu commit could
embed different rauthy binaries and nothing in the image would say so.
For a substrate whose entire claim is custody (spec 012's born-with
certificate, spec 024's hash-chained Decisions, spec 021's fail-closed
boot on an unverifiable model), the identity provider arriving by
mutable reference was the loosest link in the chain.

The base is now pinned to the digest the tag resolved to,
`sha256:e2a670c79e04ddf5947fbd6cd5dc2ec7115bb9f21132ddf03129d7b66d26f11d`,
with `0.36.0` retained as a comment so a human still reads a version.
The pinned digest is the OCI image *index*, not a per-arch manifest, so
`docker build --platform linux/amd64|arm64` still resolves the correct
leaf and the multi-arch build (spec 016) is unaffected.

rauthy reaches the image by `COPY --from`, which means no package
manifest inside the image records it and a scanner reading only
manifests cannot see it at all. Spec 029 §3.2 therefore also writes the
version and this source digest into the SBOM explicitly.

Upgrading rauthy is now a two-line edit (comment plus digest) and the
digest is what must be justified in review. `docker/Dockerfile.dev` and
`docker/compose.dev.yml` (specs 033 and 005) deliberately stay on the
tag: the dev topology is not the artifact under custody.
