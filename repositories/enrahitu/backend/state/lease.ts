/**
 * The governed lease surface (spec 032 §3.4).
 *
 * **The TTL is ten seconds and is not ours to choose.** hiqlite hardcodes
 * `LOCK_VALID_SECONDS = 10` with no configuration path, so a reconcile running
 * longer than that loses its lease WHILE STILL RUNNING and its replacement
 * begins work concurrently. That is not an edge case to document; it is the
 * normal case for any non-trivial reconcile, and it is why the fencing token is
 * mandatory rather than optional hardening.
 *
 * Enforcement is a SQL predicate at the call site, not addon machinery. Every
 * lease-guarded write carries the token and the store rejects a token below the
 * highest seen for that key:
 *
 * ```sql
 * UPDATE resource SET ..., fence = :token
 *  WHERE id = :id AND fence <= :token
 * ```
 *
 * A zombie holder's writes fail that predicate and it learns it was superseded.
