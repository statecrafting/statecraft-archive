summary: >
  Builds the observability contract that spec 001 section 4.5 declares
  and spec 021 section 3.8 deliberately deferred: every enrahitu app
  exposes a Prometheus /metrics endpoint and OTel traces as a
  non-negotiable substrate capability, recorded truthfully in
  app-model.json (observability.otel flips to true). The substrate has
  no Encore daemon (spec 008 vendored the toolchain without the CLI),
  so traces must live somewhere the app itself owns: alongside the
  OTLP exporter (off by default, env-configured) the app keeps a
  bounded in-process trace buffer that downstream surfaces (the spec
  023 admin dashboard) query same-origin. The contract deliberately
  stops at the signals: what scrapes /metrics or receives OTLP is the
  operator's choice per cell, never a template stack choice.

# 022: The observability contract

## 1. Purpose

Spec 001 §4.5 makes the promise: every enrahitu app (a platform, a
stamped tenant app) exposes the standard signals, a Prometheus
`/metrics` endpoint and OTel traces, and the app model records it.
Spec 021 §3.8 shipped the model member as `{metricsPath: "/metrics",
otel: false}` and named this spec as the one that flips it. Nothing in
`backend/` currently emits a metric or a span.

The constraint that shapes the design: there is no daemon. Encore's
own dev dashboard gets traces from the `encore` daemon process; spec
008 vendored the toolchain precisely without that CLI. So the
substrate must be its own trace sink for local/in-app consumption,
with OTLP export as the operator-facing escape hatch.

## 2. Territory

- `backend/obs/` (new service directory, nested inside the backend
  the way `kernel/` is): metrics registry + `/metrics` endpoint,
  tracer initialization, the trace ring buffer, and the internal
  query surface consumed by spec 023.
- Coordinated edits, each paired with a dated pointer amendment in
  the owning spec: instrumentation touch points in chassis plumbing
  (spec 019 layout, spec 004 auth middleware ordering if needed),
  `app-model.json` / `app-manifest.json` (spec 021) and the extractor
  (spec 020) so `observability.otel: true` is extracted, not
  hand-edited.

## 3. Behavior

### 3.1 Metrics

- `GET /metrics` serves Prometheus text format from an in-process
  registry: standard process/runtime metrics plus HTTP request
  counters and duration histograms labeled by service, endpoint, and
  status class. CoreLedger operation counters ride the same registry.
- The endpoint is part of the app, always on (the contract is
  non-negotiable; there is no flag), and unauthenticated at the app
  layer: deployment guidance (the platform's spec 010/012 line, a
  stamped app's operator docs) keeps it off the public ingress.
  Cardinality discipline: labels are static path patterns, never raw
  paths or ids.

### 3.2 Traces

- An OTel tracer runs in-process: spans for every API request
  (service, endpoint, status, duration) and for CoreLedger operations;
  kernel Decisions (spec 021) attach their decision id as a span
  attribute so a trace and its ledger record can be correlated.
- Export is operator-chosen: when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is
  set, spans ship OTLP; unset means no exporter (no phantom network
  dependency in the hermetic container).
- Independent of export, the app retains a bounded ring buffer of
  recent traces (env-tunable cap, sane default, oldest evicted) and
  `backend/obs/` exposes an internal query surface: list recent
  traces, fetch one trace's spans, subscribe to new traces. This is
  the data plane the spec 023 dashboard renders; it is not a public
  API.

### 3.3 The model tells the truth

- `observability` in the extracted model reports
  `{metricsPath: "/metrics", otel: true}` because the extractor
  observes the wiring, not because anyone edited JSON. The golden
  fixtures and hash anchors regenerate through the sanctioned
  pipeline; a hand-edited model still fails the coupling gate.

### 3.4 Implementation notes (2026-07-22)

Design points fixed at implementation time, recorded so the prose above
reads precisely:

- **Decision correlation mechanism.** Denial record ids are generated
  synchronously in the store before the fire-and-forget append (ids are
  the store's to supply, spec 021 §3.6), and the kernel announces the
  denial through a registrable observer hook (`backend/kernel/observe.ts`)
  that the tracer subscribes to: the enforcement plane imports nothing
  from `backend/obs/`, and the active span gains
  `enrahitu.decision.id`/`outcome`/`capability`/`reason`. The typed
  `KERNEL_DENIED` error carries `decisionId` too.
- **The query surface is a module, not an API.** `backend/obs/traces.ts`
  exports `listTraces`/`getTrace`/`onTrace` as plain in-process functions,
  the same convention as `backend/kernel/` and `backend/lib/`: nothing to
  expose, nothing to gate, and spec 023's admin service imports it
  directly.
- **The OTLP exporter's egress sits outside the kernel egress facade.**
  Operator-enabled infrastructure telemetry configured by env is not
  app-tier behavior; the ban-list governs `backend/` source, and no
  `backend/` code performs the export I/O itself.
- **The web static service is not instrumented.** Static asset serving is
  not an API request; `web` keeps its no-middleware posture (spec 006
  caching), and `obs` does not measure itself (a scrape must not fill the
  buffer with self-observation).
- **Extraction semantics.** The observed flip is toolchain 0.3.0
  (statecrafting spec 002 amendment, 2026-07-22): `otel` is observed from
  the wiring anchor `backend/obs/tracer.ts`, and the manifest's
  declaration must agree with the observation or extraction fails.

## 4. Acceptance

1. `curl :4000/metrics` returns Prometheus text format including at
   least the HTTP request counter and duration histogram families,
   and the counters move when API requests are made.
2. Making an API request produces a trace observable through the
   internal query surface with correctly parented spans (request span
   plus at least one CoreLedger child where applicable).
3. With `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` pointed at a collector, spans
   arrive there; with it unset, the app makes no exporter connection
   attempts.
4. `app-model.json` reports `observability.otel: true` via extraction;
   the kernel's fail-closed boot check still refuses a mutated model.
5. Template verify verbs (`npm run typecheck && npm test`) and the
   spec-spine gates stay green; the packaged image (spec 007/016)
   serves `/metrics` identically.

## 5. Out of scope

- Rendering: dashboards, charts, the admin UI (spec 023).
- Alerting, log aggregation, and long-term trace storage; the buffer
  is a recent-window convenience, not a TSDB.
- Any change to what scrapes the signals: Prometheus, collectors, and
  cloud tools remain per-cell operator choices (spec 001 §4.5).

## Amendment (2026-07-25): /metrics gains bearer authentication (spec 025)

The endpoint served unauthenticated on the public port, and its own
comment claimed that "deployment guidance keeps it off the public
ingress". No such guidance existed anywhere in the repository, and the
app offered no second listener a network policy could bind, so the
comment described a control nobody had implemented.

`ENRAHITU_METRICS_TOKEN`, when set, now requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; a missing or wrong token is 401 with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. The comparison is constant-time. The check
lives in `backend/obs/metrics-auth.ts`, split out so it is unit-testable
without constructing a raw Encore request, in the same spirit as
`lib/rate-limit-window.ts`.

This adds authentication, not a flag. The endpoint remains always on and
unflagged, so §3.1's contract is intact: when no token is configured it
serves exactly as before, which is what `npm run dev` and the suite rely
on. The packaged image always has one, provisioned at first boot
(spec 007's amendment), so the secure state is the default where it
matters and the frictionless state is the default where that matters.
