# Its lines are `NAME='value'` with no `export`, so sourcing puts every name in
# THIS shell and in no child process. Both supervised processes therefore export
# what they need from inside their own subshell (export_hiq_env below,

# material out of the other's environment.

# restore.env carries first-boot's single-shot restore decisions (spec 033 §3.5,
# spec 027 §3.3). hiqlite applies HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE at boot before the raft node
# starts, and left set in a container with a restart policy it re-applies on
# EVERY restart, discarding everything written since: a crash loop becomes
# silent, repeated data loss. first-boot.mjs records which backup it honoured and
# writes either an export or an unset here, so the operator may set the variable
# once and leave it set.
#
# There are TWO decisions, one per store, and they stay prefixed until the
# moment they enter the process that should act on them. This container runs two
# independent hiqlite nodes, and HQL_BACKUP_RESTORE is hiqlite's own name, so a
# single ambient value naming a single file is read by both: whichever node it

# so the app's node has been running on the addon's compiled-in defaults, and a
# newly provisioned ENRAHITU_HIQ_ENC_KEYS would have been dropped the same way.
#
# `export NAME` on an unset name leaves it ABSENT from the child's environment
# rather than present and empty, so a volume whose secrets.env predates the
# encryption key still boots on the addon's fallback. first-boot.mjs names that
# case rather than letting it pass silently.

# having asked. Scrubbing first is what makes ENRAHITU_SMTP_* the only surface
# that can configure mail here.
