/**
 * The control plane (spec 034): typed, tenant-scoped resources admitted through
 * the kernel, watched by revision, reconciled by leased controllers, and
 * recorded in the Decision chain.
 *
 * This is the layer spec 001 calls "application code holds intent and
 * reconciliation". It sits on the state layer (spec 032) and holds no addon
 * import of its own: every store crossing goes through `backend/state/`, which
 * adjudicates it.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately the one Kubernetes made ordinary, because it is the
 * shape that survives a lease that expires under you and a notify that never
 * arrives: desired state is a row, observed state is a status, and a controller
 * converges the second toward the first, repeatedly and idempotently. Nothing
 * here applies a change once and assumes it took.
